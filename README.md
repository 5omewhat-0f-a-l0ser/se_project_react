## Running the Project

This guide provides instructions to run the project on your local machine. 🛠️

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**  
    Clone the project repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```

    Replace `[repository URL]` with the URL of your repository.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
    Change your current directory in the terminal to the project folder:

    ```
    cd [project directory]
    ```

    Replace `[project directory]` with the name of your project folder.

3.  **Install Dependencies**  
    Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the Development Server**  
    To start the development server and view the application in your browser, execute:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    This starts the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`. The application should automatically open in your default web browser. 🌐

5.  **Build for Production (Optional)**  
    When you are ready to create a production build of the application, run:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

    This command creates optimized and minified production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

6.  **Preview the Production Build (Optional)**  
    To preview the production build locally before deployment, use:
    ```
    npm run preview
    ```
    This command starts a local server serving the files from the `dist` directory, allowing you to test the production build.

### Additional Commands

Here are some other useful commands:

- **Linting** 🧹  
  To run the linter and check for code quality issues:

  ```
    npm run lint
  ```

- **Deployment** 🚀  
  If you are deploying to GitHub Pages, you can use the following command:

  ```
    npm run deploy
  ```

Ensure that you have configured your repository and `package.json` correctly for deployment to GitHub Pages.
